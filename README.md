This is Clykr V2:
An autoclicker made with Python.


There are some configuration options in the menu:

Trigger - Which key will activate the autoclicker

Cooldown - How frequently the mouse is clicked

Mode - Default will activate the clicker only
when the key is pressed. Toggle will toggle
the activation.

Mouse - The button on the mouse to be clicked
(Left, Middle, Right)



You need to click the button on the bottom
to start the autoclicker. If you update the
configuration, the autoclicker must be stopped
then started again.
